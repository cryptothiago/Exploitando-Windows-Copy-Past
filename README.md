<h2> Web Delivery </h2>

Metasploitâ€™s Web Delivery Script is a versatile module that creates a server on the attacking machine which hosts a payload. When the victim connects to the attacking server, the payload will be executed on the victim machine.

This exploit requires a method of executing commands on the victim machine. In particular you must be able to reach the attacking machine from the victim. Remote command execution is a great example of an attack vector where using this module is possible. The web delivery script works on php, python, and powershell based applications.

This exploit becomes a very useful tool when the attacker has some control of the system, but does not possess a full shell. In addition, since the server and payload are both on the attacking machine, the attack proceeds without being written to disk. This helps keep the attacking fingerprint low.
